        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am an 18 year old Computer Science student at CSULB. I graduated high school at Polytechnic High at Long Beach. I used to have a music focus and was in my school's orchestra for my 4 years in high school. Some hobbies that I have is doing three-dimensional and two-dimensional art, playing the violin, and, of course, programming.

I was born in the Philippines in the year 2002 and migrated here to America in December of 2007. Almost all of my family work as nurses— some of them are alumni here at CSULB— and I was also close to having a nursing major, but I eventually came to like computers and programming more. One of the first things I did here at CSULB was participate in the STEM Signing Day event where I, and over 40 other people, committed to the STEM field and talked to Boeing employees. I am currently working on a small game project with another CSULB student.  </p>
